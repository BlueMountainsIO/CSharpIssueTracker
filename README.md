# Official Onset C# Issue Tracker
Hey there 👋,   
This is the offical Onset C# Issue Tracker. Onset C# is in a really early state. The server-side C# is already out and client-side C# is planned but there are some things which needs to be improved.    
If you want to help us to make C# as good as possible, you can do that by sending us every bug, optimization or feature request here. Please follow the following "guide" hwo to send us an issue the right way.

## General Rules
Pay attention to the way you express yourself. We make it a point to handle every issue as quickly as possible, at best. However, the team behind Onset is very small and we are only humans, not machines. Please try to stay constructive and friendly, even if something is annoying you. 

## Bug Report 🐛
If you have found a bug, a function doesn't work, or doesn't work properly, please keep the following things in mind so that we can fix this bug as soon as possible:
- Do you have an error in the console or logs? Attach it to the issue
- Name or describe your problem as precisely as possible
- Try to describe how to reproduce the bug. Pay attention to your environment (data like your operating system can help)

## Feature Request
Ist eine Funktion am Fehlen, du hast einen Verbesserungsvorschlag oder möchtest ein Feature was es noch nicht gibt, dann beschreibe es so gut wie möglich aus und wir sehen was sich machen lässt 😃    
Please note that it is only a suggestion, we may not accept your feature
